        <h2>Lowcomote</h2>

        <p>

          http://www.lowcomote.eu
          Lowcomote is an international project aiming at training 15 PhD students,


          Low-code development platforms (LCPD) are software development platforms on the
          Cloud, provided through a Platform-as a-Service model, which allow users to build
          completely operational applications by interacting through dynamic graphical user
          interfaces, visual diagrams and declarative languages. They address the need of
          non-programmers to develop personalised software, and focus on their domain
          expertise instead of implementation requirements.

Lowcomote will train a generation of experts that will upgrade the current trend of
LCPDs to a new paradigm, Lowcode Engineering Platforms (LCEPs). LCEPs will be open,
allowing to integrate heterogeneous engineering tools, interoperable, allowing for
cross-platform engineering, scalable, supporting very large engineering models and
social networks of developers, smart, simplifying the development for citizen developers
by machine learning and recommendation techniques. This will be achieved by injecting
in LCDPs the theoretical and technical framework defined by recent research in Model
Driven Engineering (MDE), augmented with Cloud Computing and Machine Learning techniques.

The 48-month Lowcomote project will train the first European generation of skilled
professionals in LCEPs. The 15 future scientists will benefit from an original training
and research programme merging competencies and knowledge from 5 highly recognised academic
institutions and 9 large and small industries of several domains. Co-supervision from
both sectors is a promising process to facilitate agility of our future professionals
between the academic and industrial world.

        <p>
          MegaM@Rt2 will provide scalable model-based framework for continuous development and runtime validation of complex systems.

          The overall approach of MegaM@Rt is to scale up the use of model-based
          techniques by offering proper methods and related tooling interacting between
          both design time and runtime, as well as to validate the designed and developed
          approach in concrete industrial cases involving complex systems. Thanks
          to the model-based method, different systems will be able to communicate
          through the entire development chain, and moreover it will be possible
          for systems in operation to feed back the collected data for continued development
