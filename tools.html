        making up an execution engine for State Chart XML (SCXML) and UML State Machine Diagrams.
        Both are a variant of Harel's Statecharts, which are used to model and to implement
        reactive software-intensive systems.

        Pauware Code Generator is an online platform that generate full executable
        state machines based on the PauWare engine API from XMI file produced by most UML Case tools. Try it now
